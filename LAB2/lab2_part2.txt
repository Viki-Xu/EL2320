1. Advantage: (6) will have a lower computational expense.
Drawback: (8) can react the disturbance if we move off the line, while (6) won't

2. Using (9), we can model the circular motions whose linear and angular velocity are both constant. Limitation is that we can change these velocities.
We need to fix v_0 and \omega_0 in advance.

3. To normalize the distribution.

4. Multinomial: M
 Systematic: 1

5. 
w = 1/M + \epsilon:
Multinomial: probability of surviving in 1 loop: p_s = 1/M + \epsilon
                      probabilty of surviving in M loop: P = 1 - (1 - p_s)^M
Systematic： 1

0< w < 1/M:
Multinomial: p_s = w;  P = 1 - (1 - p_s)^M
Systematic：P = Mw; 

That the weight decreases means that the probabilty of surviving will decrease.

6. 'params.Sigma_Q' is the measurement noise
'params.Sigma_R' is the process noise

-new answer-
7. We no longer resample, since we model the process to have no noise, i.e. there is no need
to rely on the measurements. The error will then entierly depend on the initial position.

8. The distribution does not converge/ the distrubution stays uniform

9. 
10000：converge to the true position quickly, but the estimation error is bigger than measurement 
variance with 100, smaller than 0.0001
-new answer-
10000: Our particles become more diffused (during update step?) as a result: the error generally 
grows compared to 100.
0.0001: For smaller Q, the convergence is slower. For too small values of Q, we are likely
to not converge at all, due to lack of resampling. This is because the measurements are 
categorized as outliers when we believe we are certain of our measurements. If we do converge,
the algorithm is rather responding to the noise in the measurements.

10. need to redo
0.0001: converge to the true position quickly,  but the estimation error is smaller.
10000: converge to the true position quickly,  but the estimation error is nearly the same.

-new answer-
10000: particles become more diffused during the prediction step. Convergence is good but the
error grows.
0.0001: particles become less diffused during prediction step - convergence is slower. The estimate
becomes more 'concentrated'

11. need to redo
For non-fixed motion, we generally need a larger noise than the fixed one to compensate for the 
uncertainty in the control input. 
That is, if our motion model is a bad representation for the actual motion, we need to compensate
for this by increasing process noise

12.
The higher dimensional motion will lead to a decreasing accuracy of estimation. We need more
particles to achieve the same accuracy. We expect the estimation error to be generally larger 
when using linear\circular motion vs fixed.

13.What do you think you can do to detect the outliers in
third type of measurements? Hint: what happens to the likelihoods of the
observation when it is far away from what the filter has predicted?
We reject those observation far way the predicted position with high likelihoods.

Best result ~ e = 11.3 +- 5.5 using Q = 5*Q_0, R = 15*R_0
Q~100, R~2 => does not converge (lags behind, eventually stops)
Q~100, R~4 => converges (lags slightly)
Q~1, R~2 => does not converge
Q~1, R~0.1 => does not converge
Q~100, R~0.1 => does not converge

Linear: Best result ~ e = 7.8 +- 3.5 using Q = 5*Q_0, R = R_0
Q~100, R~2 => e = 9.9+-4.7, converges
Q~1, R~2 => does not converge
Q~1, R~0.1 => does not converge
Q~100, R~0.1 => does not converge

Observations: Too low R, and the particles does not respond fast enough to the measurements.
This can cause the particles to wander off, where all samples are rejected as outliers. 
Too large R, and we react too fast to the noise in the measurements. Standard value is good

Too large Q, and the particles become more diffused. Good for convergence, but the error tend to
be larger. Too low Q, and the diffusion is too small, which can cause the particles to get 'ejected'
depending on the predicted motion.

Circular: Best result ~ e = 7.6 +- 3.2 using Q = 5*Q_0, R = R_0
Q~100, R~2 => e = 8.9+-4.7, converges
Q~1, R~2 => can diverge and converge, depends
Q~1, R~0.1 => does not converge
Q~100, R~0.1 => does not converge

Observations: Changes in R, similar as linear case.

Too large Q, similar as above, but the error is smaller (expected). Too small Q, and the diffuesion
is too small. Particles have a higher chance to 'recover' in this case since they are able to
predict the motion using the circular motion model.

try Q = 1 and 100, and R = 0.1=2/20 and 2

Conclusions: from Q11-Q13, we can expect the filter to be more sensetive to correct parameters
if the motion model is "wrong" compared to the real case. In general, the fixed motion model will
require the largest amount of diffusion in the prediction step (i.e. increase in R), followed
by the linear motion model. Choice of Q is not as sensetive, but we will also need a generally
increased Q for the fixed/linear case for a wider spread of particles in the measurements.
Circular motion model is least sensetive; if the estimate temporarily diverges, the motion model
should still give the best estimate compared to fixed/linear.
