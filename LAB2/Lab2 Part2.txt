1. Advantage: (6) will have a lower computational expense.
Drawback: (8) can react the disturbance if we move off the line, while (6) won't

2. Using (9), we can model the circular motions whose linear and angular velocity are both constant. Limitation is that we can change these velocities.
We need to fix v_0 and \omega_0 in advance.

3. To normalize the distribution.

4. Multinomial: M
 Systematic: 1

5. 
w = 1/M + \epsilon:
Multinomial: probability of surviving in 1 loop: p_s = 1/M + \epsilon
                      probabilty of surviving in M loop: P = 1 - (1 - p_s)^M
Systematic： 1

0< w < 1/M:
Multinomial: p_s = w;  P = 1 - (1 - p_s)^M
Systematic：P = Mw; 

That the weight decreases means that the probabilty of surviving will decrease.

10000：converge to the true position quickly, but the estimation error is bigger than measurement variance with 100, smaller than 0.0001

10. need to redo
[0.02 0.02 0.0001]: measurements: 1.3 +- 0.6, estimates: 1.4 +- 1.9. Estimation converges, but the error increases.
[200 200 1]: measurements: 1.3 +- 0.6, estimates: 1.1 +- 0.6. Estimation converges, but the error increases.
[2 2 0.01]: measurements: 1.3 +- 0.6, estimates: 0.6 +- 0.5

11. need to redo
For non-fixed motion, we generally need a larger noise than the fixed one to compensate for the uncertainty in the control input. 


12.
The higher dimensional motion will lead to a decreasing accuracy of estimation. We need more particles to achieve the same accuracy.
We expect the estimation error to be generally larger when using linear\circular motion vs fixed.

13.What do you think you can do to detect the outliers in
third type of measurements? Hint: what happens to the likelihoods of the
observation when it is far away from what the filter has predicted?
We reject those observation far way the predicted position with high likelihoods.

Fixed: absolute error analysis: measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 220.3 +- 136.
Linear: absolute error analysis: measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 9.1 +- 5.1
Circular: absolute error analysis: measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 8.6 +- 4.7

try Q = 1 and 100, and R = 0.1=2/20 and 2

Fixed: 
Q = 1, R = 2: measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 241.6 +- 142.9
Q = 100, R =2:  measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 253.8 +- 142.9
Q = 100, R =200: measurements: 24.8 +- 12.8, estimates: 18.8 +- 9.8
